## 2D-RPG (Still in Development)

This untitled game is a turn-based RPG featuring narrative elements, a 2D view, various types of spells, and enemies. Players gain items by defeating enemies encountered on the map and improve their stats. They can change their character's skills and items to make their character more powerful.

### Roadmap (Short-term)
* Quick slot integration
* Adding new ability types
* Drop system
* Complete map integration

Note: This project uses my utility plugin https://github.com/enes-ozdemir/Enca-Unity-Plugins

**Note:** This repository doesn't include the assets those I don't hold the right to distrubute. You have to acquire the assets to properly run the game in Unity. I will publish the name of the assets list after game completes. If you have the rights to use the assets I can share the my asset submodule folder for easier access.
